# LineDataset

This repository contains the dataset used for the project [*DLD*](https://github.com/manuellange/DLD).

Each folder contains the two images of which we matched the lines.
You can also find a *cpp.npz* file that contains our labeled ground truth lines which can be used instead of detecting the lines.

Additionally, precomputed results of our network can be found in the *im0.npz* and *im1.npz* files which can be visualized using our [*LineLearningInterface*](https://github.com/manuellange/LineLearningInterface).
